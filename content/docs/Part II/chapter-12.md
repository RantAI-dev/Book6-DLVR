# 12.1. Introduction to Probabilistic Diffusion Models
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Probabilistic diffusion models represent a significant milestone in the evolution of generative models, emerging as robust alternatives to earlier frameworks like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). The journey of diffusion models can be traced back to foundational concepts in stochastic processes and probabilistic modeling, where the idea of modeling data as a sequence of transformations through noise gained traction.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The roots of diffusion models lie in the theory of Markov processes and Langevin dynamics, which have long been studied in physics and applied mathematics to describe the evolution of systems over time under the influence of random noise. In the context of machine learning, researchers began exploring how these principles could be reversed to model data generation. Early works like the Denoising Score Matching framework and concepts from non-equilibrium thermodynamics set the stage for the formulation of diffusion models, providing the theoretical foundation for data generation as a process of gradually refining random noise into meaningful data.

    </div>
</div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The seminal breakthrough came with the development of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) by Ho et al. in 2020, which introduced a practical implementation of diffusion models for high-dimensional data like images. This work built upon earlier insights, such as the use of noise schedules to define a forward diffusion process and a learned denoising network to reverse the process. DDPMs demonstrated that diffusion models could outperform GANs and VAEs in generating high-quality, diverse samples without the mode collapse or adversarial training issues often seen in GANs.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Since the introduction of DDPMs, a series of refinements and innovations have propelled diffusion models to the forefront of generative modeling. Techniques like noise-aware sampling, improved network architectures, and enhanced optimization strategies have significantly improved their efficiency and scalability. Diffusion models have also been extended beyond image synthesis to applications in text-to-image generation, 3D modeling, and even molecular design.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The evolution of diffusion models reflects a broader trend in generative modeling: the move toward probabilistically grounded approaches that prioritize stability, diversity, and theoretical robustness. Unlike GANs, which rely on adversarial training and often suffer from unstable dynamics, diffusion models are rooted in well-established principles of probability and information theory, allowing for more interpretable and reliable training processes.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Today, probabilistic diffusion models are celebrated for their ability to bridge the gap between theoretical elegance and practical application. Their development underscores the importance of revisiting and reinterpreting classical ideas in light of modern computational power, ultimately reshaping how we approach the challenge of generative modeling. This historical journey highlights the interplay between mathematical theory, computational innovation, and practical needs, setting the stage for further advancements in generative AI.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The foundational ideas behind diffusion models can be traced back to early work in stochastic processes and statistical mechanics, especially related to Markov chains and Langevin dynamics. These processes were originally studied in physics to model random motion, such as the diffusion of particles in a fluid. Over time, diffusion-based techniques made their way into machine learning, particularly in image processing tasks like denoising and inpainting. The adaptation of these concepts into generative modeling was developed to address limitations in GANs and VAEs, such as instability during training and difficulties with mode diversity. One of the key breakthroughs in this area came in 2020 with the introduction of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) by OpenAI, which demonstrated that diffusion models could achieve state-of-the-art results in image generation. Since then, diffusion models have become a focal point of research, offering new possibilities in fields like image synthesis, audio generation, and solving inverse problems.

        <p><span class="fw-bold ">Figure 2:</span> Forward diffusion process.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The central idea of diffusion models is to break the data generation process into two stages: a forward diffusion process and a reverse denoising process. This differs from GANs, which directly map random noise to data, and VAEs, which use a latent space representation. In diffusion models, the forward process corrupts the data by progressively adding noise, transforming the data distribution into random noise. This process can be viewed as a Markov chain, where at each time step, a small amount of Gaussian noise is introduced to the data. Mathematically, the forward process starts with clean data $x_0$ and progressively transforms it into a noisy version $x_t$ through a series of steps:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$ q(x_t | x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{1 - \beta_t} x_{t-1}, \beta_t \mathbf{I}), $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
where $\beta_t$ is a variance schedule controlling how much noise is added at each time step. After several steps, the data becomes indistinguishable from pure noise.
</p>

<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="rounded p-4 position-relative overflow-hidden border-1 text-center" style="width: 70%">

        <p><span class="fw-bold ">Figure 3:</span> </p>
    </div>
</div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The reverse process, which is learned during training, attempts to undo this noise step by step and recover the original data. This is where the generative capacity of the model comes into play. The reverse process aims to predict the original data from noisy data, and this is done by learning a series of denoising steps that reverse the Markov chain used in the forward process. The reverse process is modeled as a series of probabilistic transitions, where at each time step, the model estimates how to remove noise to return to a less noisy state:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$ p_\theta(x_{t-1} | x_t) = \mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \mu_\theta(x_t, t), \Sigma_\theta(x_t, t)). $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here, $\mu_\theta$ and $\Sigma_\theta$ are learned parameters of the model, representing the mean and variance of the reverse transition at each step.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The learning of the reverse process is typically done through a denoising objective. The model is trained to predict the noise that was added in the forward process and, by doing so, learn how to remove it effectively. The objective function is often a variational bound or denoising score matching loss, ensuring that the model learns to reverse the noise step by step.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
One of the key strengths of diffusion models is their stability during training. Unlike GANs, which require the delicate balancing of a generator and discriminator and are prone to issues like mode collapse, diffusion models are more straightforward to train. The denoising objective is a simple regression task at each step, which helps avoid the instability and convergence issues common in adversarial training. Additionally, diffusion models are less likely to suffer from mode collapse because they explicitly model the entire data distribution through the step-by-step reverse process, ensuring that all modes of the data are captured.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Diffusion models also produce high-quality samples that rival or even surpass GANs in some applications, such as image synthesis. The gradual refinement of the samples in the reverse process allows for more control over the generation, resulting in sharper and more realistic outputs. Moreover, since diffusion models are grounded in probabilistic principles, particularly Markov chains and stochastic differential equations, they provide a clear and interpretable framework. The noise levels and the iterative nature of the model offer insights into how the generation process unfolds, providing more interpretability compared to GANs.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In terms of versatility, diffusion models can be applied to a wide range of tasks beyond image generation, including audio synthesis, video generation, and solving inverse problems like super-resolution and image inpainting. This versatility, combined with their stable training dynamics, makes them an attractive choice for researchers and practitioners in various fields. However, diffusion models also have limitations, particularly in terms of computational cost. Since they require thousands of forward and reverse steps, they can be slow to sample from compared to GANs, which generate samples in a single forward pass. Researchers are actively working on reducing the number of steps required in diffusion models to make them more computationally efficient without sacrificing quality.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Despite these challenges, diffusion models offer significant advantages in terms of stability, quality, and flexibility. They avoid common pitfalls like mode collapse and provide a probabilistic framework that can be extended to continuous-time diffusion models and other stochastic processes. These models have already demonstrated their potential in areas such as image synthesis, style transfer, and scientific simulations, and their influence is expected to grow as research continues.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, probabilistic diffusion models represent a robust and promising approach to generative modeling. They offer stable training dynamics, avoid the issues of mode collapse, and produce high-quality samples. Their probabilistic foundation, rooted in Markov chains and stochastic processes, makes them a valuable alternative to GANs and VAEs in a variety of tasks. As research continues to improve their efficiency and expand their applications, diffusion models are likely to become a key player in the generative modeling landscape.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The training of diffusion models involves minimizing a loss function that typically consists of a reconstruction error between the predicted reverse samples and the real data, as well as a likelihood estimation term that encourages the model to fit the underlying data distribution. A commonly used loss is the variational lower bound (VLB), which can be interpreted as maximizing the likelihood of generating real data while minimizing the difference between the forward and reverse processes.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Diffusion models offer several unique strengths compared to GANs and VAEs. Unlike GANs, which can suffer from mode collapse (where the generator produces only a limited variety of samples), diffusion models are less prone to this issue due to the probabilistic nature of the reverse process. Moreover, diffusion models tend to produce more stable training compared to GANs, which often require careful tuning to balance the Generator and Discriminator. Compared to VAEs, diffusion models generate high-quality samples without the need for a latent space representation, directly learning to map noise to data in a denoising framework.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
From a probabilistic standpoint, diffusion models are closely related to Markov chains and stochastic processes. The forward diffusion process is modeled as a Markov process, where the state of the data at time step $t$ only depends on the previous state $t-1$. This is mathematically expressed as:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$ q(x_t | x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \mu_t(x_{t-1}), \Sigma_t) $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
where $\mu_t(x_{t-1})$ is the mean and $\Sigma_t$ is the covariance matrix that defines the noise added at each time step. The reverse process is trained to approximate this Markov chain in reverse, allowing the model to sample from the original data distribution by gradually denoising a noisy sample.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
One of the key challenges in diffusion models is balancing the trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and stochastic sampling. During training, the model learns to minimize the distance between the real data and the denoised data at each step, while also ensuring that the reverse process is smooth and stable. This requires carefully choosing the noise schedule (i.e., how much noise is added at each step) and the network architecture used to model the reverse process.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The following code implements a probabilistic diffusion model to generate new images based on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. Probabilistic diffusion models work by progressively adding noise to the input data and then learning to reverse this process to reconstruct or generate new images. The code includes key features such as training a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) for noise prediction, applying forward and reverse diffusion processes, and saving generated images to disk. It leverages the <code>tch</code> crate for tensor operations, the <code>image</code> crate for saving images, and supports GPU acceleration through CUDA when available.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The code begins by loading and normalizing the MNIST dataset, then defines a linear noise schedule (<code>betas</code>) for the forward diffusion process. Using these, it calculates parameters like <code>alphas</code> and their square roots, which guide the addition and removal of noise during diffusion steps. A CNN is trained to predict the noise added to images in the forward process, using mean squared error as the loss function. Once trained, the model generates new images by starting with random noise and iteratively applying the reverse diffusion process to denoise and reconstruct meaningful images. These generated images are saved to disk as grayscale PNG files, showcasing the capabilities of the trained diffusion model.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To run the code, you can manually download the MNIST dataset from [Yann LeCun's MNIST page](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist). The files to download are <code>train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz</code>, <code>train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz</code>, <code>t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz</code>, and <code>t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz</code>. Once downloaded, decompress these <code>.gz</code> files using a tool like <code>gzip</code> or an archive manager. For example, using the command line, you can run <code>gzip -d train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz</code> to extract the raw file. After decompression, move the extracted files into the <code>data/</code> directory in your project. Ensure that the directory structure is correct, with the <code>data/</code> folder containing the necessary files. Then, rerun your program. With the files in place, the <code>tch::vision::mnist::load_dir</code> function should be able to load the dataset without issues. Alternatively, you can automate the process of downloading and decompressing the dataset by implementing a function in your code. Using the <code>reqwest</code> library for HTTP requests, you can write a function like <code>download_mnist_if_missing()</code> that downloads the dataset files if they are not already present in the <code>data/</code> directory. The function also decompresses the <code>.gz</code> files automatically. By calling this function in your <code>main</code> function before loading the dataset, you ensure that the necessary files are available without manual intervention. This approach is particularly useful for portability and reproducibility of your project.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
By adjusting the noise schedule and the network architecture used for denoising, you can improve the quality and diversity of the generated samples. Experimenting with different diffusion model architectures, such as using convolutional layers for image data, allows for the application of diffusion models to more complex tasks, such as image generation or super-resolution.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Probabilistic diffusion models offer a powerful framework for generative modeling, leveraging the mathematical principles of Markov chains and stochastic processes to gradually add and remove noise. These models have unique strengths, such as stability in training and a reduced tendency for mode collapse, making them an appealing alternative to GANs and VAEs. Implementing diffusion models in Rust using <code>tch-rs</code> allows for efficient experimentation with these generative models, enabling their application to tasks ranging from toy datasets to more complex data like images or time series.

# 12.2. Forward Noising Process
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In diffusion models, the forward noising process is a fundamental mechanism that progressively corrupts the original data by adding Gaussian noise. This step-by-step corruption creates a path from the original data distribution to pure noise, allowing the model to gradually degrade the data in such a way that it eventually becomes indistinguishable from random noise. The beauty of this approach lies in its probabilistic framework, which leverages mathematical constructs from stochastic processes, making it a powerful alternative to more traditional generative models like GANs and VAEs.

    </div>
</div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The core idea behind the forward noising process can be understood as a Markov chain, where each state represents a progressively noisier version of the original data. At each timestep ttt, the process involves adding a small amount of Gaussian noise to the data from the previous timestep, thereby pushing the data further toward a noisy distribution. The entire sequence of noised data points forms a Markov chain because the current state $x_t$ only depends on the immediately preceding state $x_{t-1}$, making the transitions independent of earlier states in the chain.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Mathematically, the forward process can be described by a conditional probability distribution, where each $x_t$ is sampled based on the previous state $x_{t-1}$ using a Gaussian distribution. The formula for this transition is given by:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$ q(x_t | x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{1 - \beta_t} x_{t-1}, \beta_t \mathbf{I}) $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
where $\mathcal{N}$ represents a Gaussian distribution, and $\beta_t$ is a small positive constant known as the variance or noise scale at timestep $t$. The term $\sqrt{1 - \beta_t} x_{t-1}$ represents the scaled version of the previous state, ensuring that a portion of the original information is retained in the current state. On the other hand, the variance term $\beta_t \mathbf{I}$ adds a small amount of random noise, which is sampled from a normal distribution. As ttt increases, the amount of noise added grows, and the original data becomes progressively more corrupted.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
However, instead of performing this step-by-step corruption for each timestep, a key insight is that we can directly sample from the distribution at any arbitrary timestep $t$ without traversing through all the previous steps. This is possible because the forward noising process admits a closed-form solution, which allows us to compute the noisy version of the data at any given step. The formula for this direct sampling is:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$ q(x_t | x_0) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} x_0, (1 - \bar{\alpha}_t) \mathbf{I}) $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
where $\bar{\alpha}_t = \prod_{i=1}^{t} (1 - \beta_i)$ represents the cumulative product of the noise scales up to timestep $t$. This closed-form solution is powerful because it tells us that we can generate a noisy version of the original data $x_0$ at any timestep $t$ simply by scaling the original data by $\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}$ and adding Gaussian noise scaled by $\sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t}$.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The noise schedule, defined by the values of $\beta_t$, plays a critical role in controlling how quickly the data degrades into noise. The noise schedule typically starts with very small values of $\beta_t$, ensuring that the data only gets slightly corrupted in the early timesteps. As time progresses, the values of $\beta_t$ increase, leading to more aggressive corruption. By the final timestep $T$, the data has been transformed into pure noise, with almost no recognizable information from the original data remaining.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Let’s consider an example of the forward process in action using the MNIST dataset, a common benchmark for image generation. The dataset contains grayscale images of handwritten digits, each of size $28 \times 28$. The goal of the forward noising process is to take a clean MNIST image and gradually add noise to it over a series of timesteps. Initially, the image may only be slightly corrupted, with most of the original features still visible. However, as the process continues, the noise accumulates, and the image becomes increasingly distorted until it eventually resembles random noise. This transformation is critical because it sets the stage for the reverse process, where the model will learn to denoise the image step-by-step and recover the original digit from pure noise.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Rust implementation of this forward noising process can be broken down into a few key steps. First, we define the noise schedule, which determines how much noise to add at each timestep. In the code, this is achieved by generating a sequence of values for $\beta_t$ that increase linearly from a small starting value to a larger end value over a fixed number of timesteps. Next, we compute the cumulative product of $1 - \beta_t$, which gives us the scaling factors for the original data at each timestep. Once we have the noise schedule and the cumulative scaling factors, we can apply the forward process to an MNIST image.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
At each timestep, we sample a random Gaussian noise term and add it to the scaled version of the image. This noisy image can then be saved or visualized to show how the image progressively degrades over time. In practice, we often add noise at regular intervals, such as every 100 timesteps, to observe how the image transforms over the course of the diffusion process.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The forward noising process in this code simulates how clean images from the MNIST dataset are progressively corrupted with random noise over a fixed number of timesteps. This step is essential in diffusion models, as it defines the forward process used during training and provides the noisy data required to teach the model how to reverse this corruption. By using a precomputed variance schedule (<code>betas</code>) and calculating intermediary parameters (<code>sqrt_alphas</code> and <code>sqrt_one_minus_alphas</code>), the process ensures smooth and controlled degradation of the input data.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>apply_forward_noising</code> function adds Gaussian noise to the input images step by step across 1,000 timesteps, according to the variance schedule. For each timestep <code>t</code>, random noise is generated, scaled by the noise variance (<code>sqrt_one_minus_alphas</code>), and combined with the scaled image (<code>sqrt_alphas</code>). This progressively reduces the signal-to-noise ratio in the images, resulting in fully noisy outputs by the end of the process. The calculated noisy images are then saved for visualization, demonstrating the gradual transition from clean to noisy data. This implementation ensures that the forward process aligns with the requirements of the reverse denoising process during generation.
</p>

# 12.3. Reverse Denoising Process
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The reverse denoising process in probabilistic diffusion models is where the model learns to undo the degradation caused by the forward diffusion process, progressively reconstructing the original data from noisy inputs. In contrast to the forward process, which adds noise to the data step by step, the reverse process removes this noise, denoising the data in reverse order. This process is typically modeled using a neural network that is trained to predict the denoised version of the noisy input at each time step. The reverse denoising process is crucial because it defines the model's ability to generate clean data from random noise, making it the heart of diffusion-based generative modeling.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Mathematically, the reverse process is expressed as a sequence of steps that estimate the conditional probability distribution $p_\theta(x_{t-1} | x_t)$, where $x_t$ represents the noisy data at step $t$, and $x_{t-1}$ represents the less noisy data at the previous time step. The model is trained to predict $x_{t-1}$ given $x_t$, thereby learning how to denoise the data step by step. The reverse process is modeled by the following conditional distribution:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$ p_\theta(x_{t-1} | x_t) = \mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \mu_\theta(x_t, t), \Sigma_\theta(t)) $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here, $\mu_\theta(x_t, t)$ is the predicted mean of the denoised data at time step $t-1$, and $\Sigma_\theta(t)$ is the variance that models the uncertainty in the prediction. The neural network with parameters $\theta$ learns to predict $\mu_\theta$, which represents the denoised output.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The denoising score, which estimates the gradient of the data distribution, plays a vital role in guiding the reverse process. The score essentially tells the model how much noise to remove at each step by predicting the gradient of the log-probability of the data with respect to the input. This score can be interpreted as a denoising signal that helps the model recover the clean data progressively. Mathematically, this can be seen as minimizing the score matching loss, where the model is trained to match the score function of the true data distribution.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$ L_{\text{score}} = \mathbb{E}_{q(x_t, x_0)} \left[ \| \nabla_{x_t} \log q(x_t | x_0) - \nabla_{x_t} \log p_\theta(x_t) \|^2 \right] $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This loss encourages the model to learn the correct denoising function by minimizing the difference between the true gradient of the data distribution and the predicted gradient from the model. The training process involves minimizing this loss over multiple time steps, ensuring that the model learns how to remove noise in a way that reconstructs the original data accurately.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The reverse denoising process relies heavily on the structure of the forward diffusion process. Since the forward process progressively adds noise to the data, the reverse process must learn how to remove that noise in a stepwise fashion. The key idea is that each step of denoising should not aim to recover the entire clean data but instead remove a small amount of noise, gradually refining the noisy sample back into a realistic data point.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Training the reverse denoising process typically involves minimizing a loss function that captures the error between the predicted denoised data and the actual data. One of the common loss functions used is mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted denoised output and the true data at each time step. This ensures that the model's predictions become progressively more accurate as the reverse process proceeds.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
However, the reverse process also faces challenges such as stability and convergence, especially when dealing with highly noisy inputs. If the noise is too extreme, or if the model is not properly trained, the reverse process may diverge or fail to converge to realistic data. This makes it crucial to design the neural network architecture and the training process in a way that ensures smooth denoising across all time steps.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This code implements a diffusion model on the MNIST dataset, focusing on training a model to reverse the forward noising process and generate clean images from noise. The scenario involves using the MNIST dataset, a standard benchmark for handwritten digit recognition, as the foundation for a probabilistic generative task. Key features include a cosine noise schedule for smoother noise transitions, a U-Net-based architecture for noise prediction, and the ability to train the model using a variational lower bound (VLB) loss. Additionally, the code incorporates denoising, where a noisy sample is progressively refined into a clean image, and visualization of the results via saved images.

The code begins by normalizing and preparing the MNIST dataset, then applies a cosine noise schedule to define how noise is added during the forward process. The U-Net model is trained on noisy images, predicting the noise component at each step using the VLB loss. During denoising, a noisy sample (randomly initialized) undergoes iterative refinement: the model predicts noise at each timestep, which is subtracted from the current state to make the image progressively cleaner. Additional Gaussian noise is added except for the final step to match the forward process. The final denoised images, representing the generated digits, are saved to disk for evaluation and visualization.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To better understand how the reverse process works in practice, it can be useful to visualize the step-by-step denoising process on an image dataset. By observing how the noisy data is progressively refined into clean images, we can gain insights into the effectiveness of the reverse diffusion model. This code snippet extends the previous implementation by introducing step-by-step visualization of the reverse diffusion process. It saves intermediate denoised images at specified intervals during the reverse diffusion loop, allowing users to observe how noisy data evolves into clean images. The new function, <code>denoise_and_visualize_images</code>, is similar to the existing <code>denoise_images</code> function but includes logic to save images at each step or at regular intervals, helping to analyze the model's performance in refining noisy samples.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The snippet works by iterating over the timesteps of the reverse diffusion process in reverse order, as before. At each step, the model predicts the noise in the current sample, which is then removed to refine the image. If the current timestep matches the specified interval or is the final step, the intermediate images are saved to a subdirectory corresponding to the current step. These saved images enable a detailed examination of how the diffusion model progressively reconstructs clean images from noise, providing a clearer understanding of its effectiveness.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The reverse denoising process is the key to generating realistic data in probabilistic diffusion models. By learning to reverse the noise added during the forward process, the model can reconstruct clean data from noisy inputs. The denoising score guides the process, and the model is trained to predict the denoised data using loss functions like mean squared error (MSE). Implementing this process in Rust using tch-rs allows for efficient experimentation and visualization, enabling developers to explore the powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models.
</p>

# 12.4. Variational Diffusion Models
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Variational diffusion models extend traditional diffusion models by incorporating variational inference techniques, providing a more flexible and robust framework for learning the reverse denoising process. While traditional diffusion models focus on a deterministic reverse process to remove noise from data, variational diffusion models utilize probabilistic reasoning to infer a posterior distribution that better approximates the data distribution. This is done by employing the evidence lower bound (ELBO), a well-known objective in variational inference that provides a lower bound to the true log-likelihood of the data, balancing between reconstruction accuracy and regularization.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The ELBO plays a central role in training variational diffusion models, optimizing the model by ensuring that it learns to effectively reconstruct the original data while regularizing the latent representations. Mathematically, the ELBO is defined as:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$ \text{ELBO} = \mathbb{E}_{q(x_0, x_1, \dots, x_T)} \left[ \log p_\theta(x_0 | x_1) - D_{\text{KL}}(q_\phi(x_t | x_{t-1}) \| p_\theta(x_t | x_{t-1})) \right] $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here, $q_\phi$ represents the variational posterior distribution, which approximates the true posterior distribution over the latent variables at each time step. The ELBO consists of two components: the reconstruction term, which encourages the model to generate data that is as close as possible to the original data, and the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence term, which acts as a regularizer, ensuring that the learned variational posterior is close to the prior distribution. By optimizing the ELBO, variational diffusion models are able to strike a balance between accurately reconstructing the data and maintaining a meaningful latent space representation.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The variational posterior distribution in these models serves as an approximation of the true posterior during the reverse process. Unlike traditional diffusion models, which rely on deterministic updates during the reverse process, variational diffusion models maintain a stochastic element, which allows for better handling of complex data distributions. The variational posterior is typically modeled using a neural network, parameterized by $\phi$, that takes the noisy data $x_t$ and learns a distribution from which the denoised output $x_{t-1}$ can be sampled. This stochastic modeling improves the flexibility of the model, allowing it to learn richer, more complex data representations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Incorporating variational methods into diffusion models enhances their ability to learn complex data distributions by providing a more probabilistic approach to the reverse denoising process. Traditional deterministic approaches may struggle with highly complex data, where a fixed deterministic function may not capture all the nuances of the data distribution. By introducing a variational framework, the model gains the ability to explore a wider range of potential outputs during the reverse process, improving sample quality and ensuring a more robust approximation of the underlying data distribution.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
There are trade-offs between using a variational approach versus a purely deterministic approach. The variational approach introduces additional complexity, both in terms of the model structure and the training process. This added complexity can lead to longer training times and higher computational costs, particularly when optimizing the ELBO and training the variational posterior. However, the benefits are significant, particularly for tasks involving high-resolution images or complex generative tasks where the model needs to learn intricate data patterns. Variational diffusion models are better suited to handling these types of data, providing more diverse and higher-quality samples.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another benefit of the variational approach is its ability to handle uncertainty more effectively. By modeling the reverse process stochastically, the model can better account for uncertainty in the data, leading to improved robustness and generalization. This is particularly important in real-world applications, where data often contains noise or missing values, and the model must learn to handle these imperfections effectively.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The code implements a variational diffusion model to train and apply a denoising process on images from the MNIST dataset. The forward diffusion process adds Gaussian noise to the input data over a series of steps, while the reverse process is designed to iteratively denoise the noisy images to reconstruct clean data. Unlike deterministic diffusion models, this variational approach models the reverse process as a probabilistic distribution, learning the mean and variance for each denoising step. This allows the model to handle uncertainty in the reverse process, enhancing its robustness. Features include a cosine noise schedule for improved noise distribution, a U-Net architecture to model the reverse process, and a variational lower bound loss function to optimize the model.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The code begins by preparing the MNIST dataset and normalizing it for use in the diffusion process. A cosine noise schedule determines the amount of noise added during the forward diffusion, which progressively corrupts the data. The reverse process, modeled by a U-Net neural network, predicts the mean and variance of the denoised distribution at each step. During training, the model minimizes the KL divergence between the predicted distribution and the ground-truth noise, leveraging the variational lower bound as the loss function. In the denoising process, the learned distribution is used iteratively to remove noise and reconstruct the images. The final clean images, generated from purely noisy inputs, are saved for visualization. This approach demonstrates the power of probabilistic modeling in diffusion-based image generation.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To demonstrate the power of variational diffusion models, a practical example could involve training the model on a dataset of high-resolution images. High-resolution image generation is a challenging task that requires the model to learn complex structures and textures. Variational diffusion models, with their ability to handle stochasticity and model uncertainty, are well suited for this task. Training such a model involves gradually adding noise to the images and then learning to reverse this noise using the variational posterior distribution.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
During training, visualizing the reconstructed images at different stages of the reverse process can help understand how well the model is learning to denoise and reconstruct the original high-resolution images. By experimenting with different variational priors and variational families, developers can improve the quality and diversity of the generated images, ensuring that the model produces realistic and visually appealing outputs.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Variational diffusion models enhance traditional diffusion models by incorporating variational inference to provide a more flexible and robust framework for the reverse denoising process. The evidence lower bound (ELBO) serves as the optimization objective, balancing between accurate reconstruction and regularization of the latent space. By modeling the reverse process probabilistically, variational diffusion models can handle more complex data distributions, providing higher-quality samples and better generalization. Implementing these models in Rust using tch-rs allows for effective experimentation with high-resolution image generation and other challenging generative tasks, demonstrating the power of combining diffusion processes with variational inference techniques.

# 12.5. Applications of Diffusion Models
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Diffusion models have demonstrated their versatility and power across a wide range of real-world applications, making them a cornerstone of modern generative modeling. One of the most prominent applications is in image synthesis, where diffusion models have proven capable of generating high-quality, realistic images that rival those produced by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). By iteratively adding and removing noise, diffusion models can capture intricate details and complex textures in images, making them ideal for tasks like super-resolution, where the goal is to enhance the quality of low-resolution images, and style transfer, where an image is transformed to reflect a particular artistic style. With the rise of Stable Diffusion, diffusion models have become particularly relevant in image generation use cases where users can input text prompts to guide the model in generating highly detailed, creative images. This use case has exploded in industries like digital art, advertising, and gaming, where customizable image generation allows for faster and more personalized content creation.
</p>

<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="rounded p-4 position-relative overflow-hidden border-1 text-center" style="width: 100%">
        {{< figure src="/images/4HG3uqNnfrrynHQ7lsB4-TiZfI6bj3ZfB6vBVYKis-v1.png" >}}
        <p><span class="fw-bold ">Figure 5:</span> Visual explanation on how stable diffusion transform text prompt to image.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In addition to image synthesis, diffusion models have found applications in audio generation, such as synthesizing realistic sounds or generating music. The iterative denoising process can be adapted to the time-domain data inherent in audio signals, allowing diffusion models to generate high-quality audio samples that are coherent and diverse. Another promising application is in time series forecasting, where diffusion models can be used to predict future values of a sequence, such as stock prices or weather conditions. By learning the underlying distribution of the time series data, diffusion models can generate multiple plausible future scenarios, providing valuable insights for decision-making processes. For example, incorporating user prompts into a time series diffusion model could allow users to generate specific scenarios of interest, such as forecasting economic conditions under certain constraints, enhancing their practical utility.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Beyond traditional data generation tasks, diffusion models also play an important role in enhancing data privacy and security. Techniques such as differential privacy can be integrated into diffusion models to ensure that the generated data does not inadvertently reveal sensitive information about the training data. By carefully controlling the noise added during the diffusion process, developers can use these models to generate synthetic datasets that preserve the statistical properties of the original data while maintaining privacy. Moreover, diffusion models have shown promise in improving adversarial robustness, as the iterative noise addition and removal process can make it harder for adversarial attacks to manipulate the generated outputs. In this context, Stable Diffusion enables privacy-preserving content generation, as users can guide models to generate sensitive or secure information under controlled conditions, reducing the risk of data leakage.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Diffusion models are also being explored in scientific research, where their generative capabilities can help solve complex problems. For example, in drug discovery, diffusion models are used to generate novel molecular structures that satisfy specific chemical properties, accelerating the discovery of new compounds. The ability of diffusion models to learn complex, high-dimensional distributions makes them suitable for simulating physical processes, such as fluid dynamics or molecular interactions, where accurate simulations are critical for understanding natural phenomena. Prompt-based generation, similar to Stable Diffusion use cases in image generation, can also be leveraged in scientific fields where specific prompts (such as desired chemical properties or molecular configurations) are used to guide the model in generating potential solutions for complex scientific challenges.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The versatility of diffusion models lies in their ability to generate a wide variety of data types, ranging from images and audio to time series and molecular structures. This versatility stems from the probabilistic nature of diffusion models, which allows them to learn rich, complex data distributions and generate diverse samples. The probabilistic framework also allows for stochastic sampling, which helps in generating different variations of the data, ensuring that the model does not just memorize the training data but can generalize to new, unseen examples. In text-guided applications like Stable Diffusion, users can inject creative control by specifying prompts to generate variations on demand, opening new possibilities for personalized and custom content in industries like marketing, entertainment, and education.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
However, the use of diffusion models also raises important ethical considerations. The ability to generate realistic synthetic data has implications for data privacy, as there is a risk that the generated data could inadvertently reveal sensitive information about the individuals in the training dataset. Fairness is another concern, as the training data used to train diffusion models could contain biases, which could then be reflected in the generated data. Ensuring transparency in how these models are trained and how their outputs are used is crucial, especially when diffusion models are used in sensitive areas like healthcare or finance. When applying Stable Diffusion in areas such as media or journalism, careful consideration must be given to the potential misuse of AI-generated content in spreading misinformation or deepfakes.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Diffusion models are pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence by advancing the field of generative modeling. Unlike GANs, which can be difficult to train due to issues like mode collapse, diffusion models provide a more stable training process, as they do not require the adversarial setup of GANs. This stability, combined with their ability to generate high-quality samples, makes diffusion models a powerful tool for researchers and practitioners looking to explore the limits of generative modeling. With the rise of prompt-based generation, as demonstrated in Stable Diffusion, these models offer an accessible interface for non-technical users to generate high-quality, custom images by simply inputting descriptive prompts. This revolutionizes content creation in fields ranging from entertainment and advertising to scientific research, where creative flexibility and technical precision can now be seamlessly integrated into the generative process.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Stable Diffusion is a powerful generative model that transforms a text prompt into a high-resolution image by leveraging diffusion processes. This model is an evolution of diffusion-based generative models that add and remove noise from image representations in a controlled, iterative manner. At a high level, the process involves three stages: converting the text prompt into a text representation, refining a noisy image representation over several timesteps, and upscaling the final image representation into a high-resolution image. The text-to-image generation pipeline is rooted in mathematical constructs from stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and neural network-based encoding techniques, leading to a flexible and computationally efficient generative model.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the first step, the text prompt is converted into a mathematical representation, or vector, that encodes the semantic meaning of the input prompt. The text representation process is broken into two sub-steps: tokenization and text encoding.
</p>

<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="rounded p-4 position-relative overflow-hidden border-1 text-center" style="width: 100%">
        {{< figure src="/images/4HG3uqNnfrrynHQ7lsB4-uw9lps2iqDhacgvy9hIe-v1.gif" >}}
        <p><span class="fw-bold ">Figure 6:</span> Text representation generation in Stable Diffusion.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Tokenization involves breaking the input text into individual components known as tokens. For example, a prompt like “a cute and adorable bunny” is split into individual tokens, including "a," "cute," "and," "adorable," and "bunny." Special tokens such as <start> and <end> are added to mark the boundaries of the prompt. Stable Diffusion uses a fixed-length token sequence, typically 77 tokens, to ensure computational efficiency and consistency. If a prompt has fewer tokens, it is padded with <end> tokens; if it exceeds 77 tokens, the prompt is truncated.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
After tokenization, text encoding is performed using a neural network, commonly a CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) model. CLIP is pre-trained on large datasets of text-image pairs, learning to map both text and images into a common vector space. Let $T$ be the token sequence of the prompt. The text encoder, parameterized by $\theta_T$, converts $T$ into a high-dimensional vector representation $z_T$, where the vector encodes semantic information relevant to the image generation task. Mathematically, the text encoding can be described as:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$z_T = f_{\theta_T}(T)$$

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This vector $z_T$ is critical for guiding the image generation process.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Stable Diffusion models rely on a forward and reverse diffusion process to generate images. The forward process incrementally adds noise to an image representation, starting from a random noise vector, while the reverse process denoises this vector step by step, conditioned on the text representation. This reverse process is modeled by iteratively refining a noisy image representation across a fixed number of timesteps.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In mathematical terms, let $x_0$ represent the final image to be generated and $x_T$ represent the initial random noise vector sampled from a Gaussian distribution $x_T \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$. The forward diffusion process adds Gaussian noise to the image representation at each timestep $t$, which transforms the clean image $x_0$ into a sequence of noisy images $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_T$ over time. The relationship between $x_t$ and $x_0$ is given by:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$q(x_t | x_0) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} x_0, (1 - \bar{\alpha}_t) I)$$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
where $\bar{\alpha}_t$ is the cumulative product of noise scales. The reverse process then aims to reconstruct $x_0$ from $x_T$ by progressively removing noise.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
At each timestep $t$, a neural network called UNet predicts the noise component that should be removed from the current image representation $x_t$. The UNet model takes three inputs: the noisy image representation $x_t$, the text representation $z_T$, and the current timestep $t$. The network learns to predict the noise $\epsilon_\theta(x_t, z_T, t)$ that corrupts the image:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$ \hat{x}_0 = \frac{x_t - \sqrt{1 - \alpha_t} \epsilon_\theta(x_t, z_T, t)}{\sqrt{\alpha_t}} $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
where $\hat{x}_0$ is the predicted image at timestep $t$. The text representation $z_T$ helps guide the noise prediction so that the denoised image adheres closely to the prompt.
</p>

    </div>
</div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To ensure that the generated image is strongly influenced by the text prompt, Stable Diffusion employs a guidance mechanism. This is done by introducing a guidance scale $w$ that adjusts the contribution of the text-conditioned noise relative to generic noise (noise generated with an empty prompt). Let $\epsilon_{\text{empty}}(x_t, t)$ represent the generic noise conditioned on an empty prompt. The final noise prediction used to refine the image is computed as:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$ \epsilon_\theta^{\text{final}}(x_t, z_T, t) = \epsilon_{\text{empty}}(x_t, t) + w \left( \epsilon_\theta(x_t, z_T, t) - \epsilon_{\text{empty}}(x_t, t) \right) $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
where $w$ controls how strongly the image adheres to the text prompt. Larger values of $w$ increase adherence to the prompt but may decrease image quality if set too high.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Once the noise has been predicted, Stable Diffusion refines the image representation by removing a portion of the predicted noise. The amount of noise removed is determined by a scheduler function, which controls how much of the predicted noise should be subtracted at each timestep. The updated image representation at timestep $t+1$ is calculated as:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$ x_{t+1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha_t}} \left( x_t - \frac{1 - \alpha_t}{\sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t}} \epsilon_\theta^{\text{final}}(x_t, z_T, t) \right) $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This iterative refinement continues for a predefined number of timesteps, typically 50 or 100, where each step incrementally denoises the image representation until it converges to a final clean image $x_0$.
</p>

<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="rounded p-4 position-relative overflow-hidden border-1 text-center" style="width: 100%">

        <p><span class="fw-bold ">Figure 8:</span> Image upscaling method in stable diffusion.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
After the final refinement step, Stable Diffusion generates a high-resolution image from the denoised image representation using a decoder. The decoder is another neural network that transforms the lower-dimensional image representation into a full-resolution image that adheres closely to the input text prompt. This decoding step ensures that the image quality is high and the resolution meets the requirements specified in the prompt.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Mathematically, the decoder function $g_\theta$ is applied to the final image representation x0x_0x0 to generate the image:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$I = g_\theta(x_0)$$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
where $I$ is the final output image. The decoder adds the final level of detail and texture, ensuring that the generated image is photorealistic or artistically coherent based on the prompt.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Writing text prompts for generative models like Stable Diffusion can often be a trial-and-error process, where users iteratively add, modify, or remove keywords to refine the generated image. For example, starting with a simple prompt like "a cute bunny," you might experiment by adding phrases like "in the style of a cute Pixar character" to see how the image evolves. This process can be heuristic and requires some intuition about how different words and descriptions influence the model's output. Therefore, understanding how specific keywords affect image generation is crucial for efficiently crafting prompts. By observing the changes in images generated from prompts that differ only in certain keywords, users can better fine-tune their descriptions to achieve the desired visual result.

        <p><span class="fw-bold ">Figure 9:</span> How prompt keywords affect image generation in stable diffusion model.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The text-to-image functionality of Stable Diffusion has become incredibly useful in creative industries such as digital art, content creation, and advertising, where users can generate high-quality images by simply inputting descriptive prompts. This model allows for rapid prototyping and creative exploration, reducing the need for manual image generation or editing. Additionally, the ability to condition image generation on textual prompts offers flexibility and personalization, as users can tweak prompts to generate various styles, themes, and designs.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Stable Diffusion also has applications beyond image generation. For instance, the model can be adapted for tasks like super-resolution, where a low-resolution image is upscaled to a higher resolution, and style transfer, where the model transforms the style of an input image based on a text description. Additionally, the model's architecture lends itself well to data privacy applications, where differential privacy mechanisms can be applied to ensure that the generated images do not reveal sensitive information from the training dataset.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In summary, Stable Diffusion is a mathematically grounded model that leverages probabilistic diffusion processes to iteratively refine noisy image representations into high-resolution images conditioned on text prompts. The model's strength lies in its ability to balance computational efficiency with image quality, making it a versatile tool for various generative tasks in both creative and technical fields.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To implement Stable Diffusion using the <code>tch-rs</code> crate in Rust, we can follow the structure outlined in the explanation you provided. The main components include converting a text prompt into a vector representation (text encoding), refining the noisy image representation through the forward and reverse diffusion processes (using a UNet for noise prediction), and finally decoding the refined image into a high-resolution output. Below is an end-to-end implementation of this process in Rust, using the <code>tch-rs</code> crate.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This code implements the Stable Diffusion architecture, a state-of-the-art generative model for creating high-quality images from textual descriptions. Stable Diffusion operates by combining a text encoder (CLIP) for prompt embeddings, a U-Net for image refinement during diffusion steps, and a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for encoding and decoding image latents. The process involves a forward diffusion phase, where noise is added to latent representations, and a reverse diffusion phase, where noise is iteratively removed to reconstruct the image. This implementation uses hardcoded parameters for the model and input configuration, focusing on predefined prompts and dimensions while incorporating advanced features like guidance scaling to improve generation quality.

The code initializes key components of the Stable Diffusion pipeline, including the tokenizer, VAE, and U-Net, and preprocesses the input data. The diffusion process begins with the generation of random noise latents or the transformation of an input image (for img2img tasks). During reverse diffusion, the U-Net predicts noise at each timestep, guided by text embeddings generated from the prompt using the CLIP model. The predicted noise is used by the scheduler to iteratively denoise the latents, gradually refining them into coherent images. Finally, the VAE decodes the denoised latents into RGB images, which are saved to disk. The integration of guidance scaling enhances alignment between the text prompt and generated image, ensuring high-quality results.

The Stable Diffusion 3 architecture implemented in the following code uses a state-of-the-art latent diffusion model for text-to-image generation. It combines multiple components: a CLIP-based text encoder (<code>ClipWithTokenizer</code>) to convert input prompts into semantic embeddings, an MMDiT (Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer) for denoising and latent sampling, and a VAE (Variational Autoencoder) for decoding the refined latent representation into a final high-quality image. The architecture incorporates features like configurable CFG (Classifier-Free Guidance) for precise control over image generation, Euler sampling for iterative refinement, and time-shift scaling for adaptive scheduling. The model can handle complex prompts, generating high-resolution images with customizable guidance scales, resolution, and number of inference steps.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The code generates images by first encoding the text prompt into embeddings using the <code>ClipWithTokenizer</code>. These embeddings are used as inputs for the MMDiT, which iteratively refines noisy latent representations into coherent representations using the Euler sampling process. The refinement steps are guided by the CFG scale and optionally influenced by Skip Layer Guidance (SLG) for additional control over specific layers. The denoised latent output is passed through the VAE decoder, which reconstructs the final image from the latent space. The entire process is performed on a device (CPU or GPU), with options for reproducibility through seed initialization, and the final output is saved as an image file. This pipeline emphasizes modularity and flexibility for high-quality text-to-image synthesis.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Stable Diffusion is a cutting-edge generative model designed for high-quality text-to-image synthesis, leveraging latent diffusion processes. It operates in a compressed latent space to balance computational efficiency and output fidelity, combining a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for encoding and decoding images, a text encoder (often based on CLIP or similar architectures) to convert textual prompts into semantic embeddings, and a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to iteratively refine noisy latent representations into coherent images. The model incorporates advanced techniques like Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) to control the balance between creativity and adherence to prompts, along with sophisticated sampling methods such as Euler or DDIM to enhance generation quality. Stable Diffusion is capable of producing high-resolution, visually appealing images with diverse customization options, making it a powerful tool in AI-driven creativity and design.
